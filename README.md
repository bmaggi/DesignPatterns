## Design Patterns
A [Papyrus](http://www.eclipse.org/papyrus/) model containing some classic design patterns

### Modeling flavor 
- each pattern should be in an independent "controlled model"
- description should be done use a majority of Documentation (also some pure UML comment)
   - documentation for property should be 2/3 lines
   - documentation for package should be 20/30 lines
